GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that their problem is
not that any problems you think are in the code are hidden from them.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  We therefore
have decided to continue to distribute the GNU GPLv3.0 license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  "modify" or "modification" refers to copying or adapting all or part
of the Program for any purpose.

  "entity" refers to any individual or organization that distributes the
Program to recipients.

  "entity" also refers to any individual or organization that receives
the Program from an entity.

  1. Source code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that is defined by a
recognized standards body, such as POSIX or IEEE, and is documented in
the official standard.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is externally available.  A "Major Component", in this
context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and
so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable
work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamic
link libraries that the work is specifically designed to require, and
that cannot be replaced by functionally equivalent libraries that are
available as source code.

  The "Basic Permissions" are the rights to use, copy, distribute, and
modify the Program.  They are given to you for the duration of the
copyright term, and are granted to anyone who obtains a copy of the
Program.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and distribute copies of the covered work
in any medium, provided your copyright notice and this License are
conspicuous in all copies that you make.  You may charge any price or
no price for each copy that you convey, and you may at any time offer
support or warranty protection for a fee.

  You may modify your copy or copies of the covered work, or any part
of it, thus forming a work based on the covered work, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute, or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the covered work
    or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified work includes a "print" or "write" function
    normally used for writing to the console, you must cause that
    function to output an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such a notice, your work need not make
    any such notice.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the covered
work, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to
those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the covered work, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the covered work.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the covered
work with the covered work (or with a derivative thereof) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the covered work as a means of enforcing, against the
work's users, your or third party's intellectual property rights or
contractual rights.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the covered work in any medium,
provided that you retain the copyright notice and this License in all
copies that you make, and provided that you license the entire work to
all third parties under the terms of this License.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the covered work, as object code or
source code, under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
also meet the conditions of section 2 above.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a work based on the covered work in object code form
under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

    a) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
    Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for
    software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer,
    valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
    spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
    anyone who possesses the object code either (1) access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
    no charge, or (2) a copy of the Corresponding Source for a charge
    no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source.

    c) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same place through the same means at
    no charge.  You need not require recipients to register with you
    or any other entity to access the Corresponding Source.

    d) Convey the object code as part of a work that contains at least
    one other work, and convey the Corresponding Source for all
    works in the same way.

  7. Additional Terms.

  Additional permission terms may be added to the Program under the
terms of this License.  The additional terms must be clearly identified
as such and must not limit the rights granted in this License.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, and you cure the violation prior
to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights applies to the entire Program and to any
derivative works based on the Program, to any patent licenses granted
under this License, and to any license grants for works based on the
Program.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License to receive or run a copy
of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered
work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called a "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent licenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for any
party to copy, modify, propagate, or distribute by acquiring or
modifying the work, then the patent license you have granted to that
party is deemed to have been terminated.

  If, before receiving the Program, you have granted a patent license
to some of the recipients of the Program, and if the Program contains
no new material licensed under this License, then you must cause that
patent license to be terminated.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the refusal of, any of the rights that are granted under
this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are aware of a
discriminatory patent license (as defined above) that applies to some
of the recipients of the Program, and if the Corresponding Source of
the work is not available for any party to copy, modify, propagate, or
distribute by acquiring or modifying the work.  You must not convey the
Program to any party for which you have granted a discriminatory patent
license.

  If you become aware of any patent license that is discriminatory, you
must cause it to be terminated.  If you become aware of any patent
license that is discriminatory, you must immediately cease conveying
the Program to that party and cause any patent licenses that you have
granted to that party to be terminated.

  If you have received a patent license from a contributor that is
discriminatory, you must cause that patent license to be terminated.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that prohibit
the conveying of a copy received under this License, the terms of this
License have no effect.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a linker interface is used, you have
the option of following the terms and conditions of the GNU General
Public License version 3 or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVIDE A FAILURE OR OTHER PROBLEM, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO BE COMPLIED WITH ANY REASONABLE
REQUIREMENTS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make the "about" box show
the copyright notice and the license notice.

  For example, in a terminal program:

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should be replaced with
appropriate commands that display the license information.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
have the option of providing it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may also provide it under the terms of the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.  If your program is a subroutine

Public License instead of this License.
